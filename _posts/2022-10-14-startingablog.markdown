# Starting a blog (with Jekyll and Vercel)

Back in 2018 , when I was a fresh highschool graduate, It was all too familiar with anyone who passed the somewhat important Cambodian BAC II exams, an exam considered important that one has to pass in order to graduate highschool and choose the college major of their liking. While the story of how I, a professional communications major , somehow became involved with game development, is for another day. Looking back, I learned alot of things from making games in various engines, to python scripting , to web development and along the way I ran into many problems so I'd thought I'd document them here, in case someone find them useful in the future.

To simplify things , I decided to go with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) actually writing the blog, because I don't want the frustration of tweaking HTML and CSS. I found out about Jekyll by chance when I was reading a blog post on [Benjamin's](https://benjaminwarner.dev/about) blog, prior to this, I thought I have to either mess around with HTML and CSS to get what I want or pay quite a hefty fee for a monthly service to make the site itself and for hosting (i live in a third world country), which crosses over to the other part of starting a website, the hosting. This site is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), for free!***(this post is not sponsored by vercel)*** and you can even link your custom domain to it , completely free of charge. It took me a few hours to setup this site , with almost no experience with HTML or CSS. I will not bore you with the details , there are many tutorials out there with a simple google search. So , if you are reading this post , stay tuned for future posts! that's all for now (until next time?)
