# Creating augmented data for ML 
![image](\assets\img\eden.jpg){: width="600"}
it's been awhile since my last post , but during that time i've been tinkering around with various deep learning models and frameworks, and what i've found out is that augmented data is important in order to train accurate ML models, while there are libraries made for augmentations like [albumentations](https://albumentations.ai) readily available , the type of augmentation that i want to do is not avialable anywhere (if there is a library that can do this ,please do tell).
what im trying to do is takin a labeled image from labelme and then putting it in a different background,
