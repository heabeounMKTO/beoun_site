**disclaimer**: there is alot of mentions of penis in this blog post

I don't remember how I got the idea to make a multiplayer FPS (*first person shooter*) game, where you play as a penis (it's likely either when I am commuting somewhere or one of those late night discord calls with my friends) , but I've been kicking around that idea for a few weeks at this point so I decided to jump on that idea and make it happen, mind you I've never made/finished a full game before ,only working on a few *"small projects"*toying with ideas here and there but ultimately abandoning it. (let's hope I dont abandon this one as well). so this would be quite a challenge for me.

### The "*core design elements*" 
because this whole project is a joke that circulates between me and my friends, I think it's only proper that I make it as ridiculous as possible , but still on the "penis" topic of course.

so, the core design of this game (*that i thought up for now*) is:

> - the player is a **penis**

> - everything is penis based, penis gun, penis grenade, penis health (*erection level?*)

> - when a penis dies it ejaculates (*this is a suggestion from someone, who I will not name*)

> - there are multiple penis classes: *`big , small , short , long , stubby etc..`* these are the ideas for now, it is subjected to changes

### Starting the project

I chose [Unity](https://unity.com/) to develop PenisShooter because of 2 reasons:

It is the platform i have the most experience with for game development , the other engine I know is the open source [Cocos Creator](https://www.cocos.com/en/creator) , which is really great for web-based 2D games but really lacking in the 3D department, at least for me, Also since I would probably be working alone, there are alot of unity resources out there that I can refer to in the case I get stuck on trying to make something work.
